#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/catherine.git

cd ./catherine

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
