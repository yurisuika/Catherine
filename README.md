# Catherine

Catherine is a companion mod for *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)*. Made for Fabric, it focuses on custom colours hand tailored to the resourcepack.

If you plan to use this with OptiFine you MUST disable Custom Colors unless you want them to be broken.

## DOWNLOADS

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/catherine.git

cd ./catherine

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
