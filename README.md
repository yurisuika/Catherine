**Catherine** is Fabric mod for Minecraft. A companion for *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)*, it focuses on custom colors hand tailored to the resourcepack.

If you plan to use this with OptiFine you MUST disable Custom Colors unless you want them to be broken.

The HUD fix is now part of *[Raised](https://github.com/yurisuika/Raised)* for 1.18 and up!

Catherine is soon to be replaced by *[Lucid](https://github.com/yurisuika/Lucid)*, which is fully configurable from in-game and is much better made!

#### Compiling

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.19 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/catherine.git

cd ./catherine

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
